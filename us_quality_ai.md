== Requirements

The goal is to build a demonstrable MVP system capable of evaluating and improving the quality of user stories (US) using AI agents. The system must produce explainable outputs and clearly showcase quality improvements suitable for presentation in a PhD conference setting.

=== Functional Requirements (MoSCoW)

*Must Have:*
- Ability to ingest a set of user stories from CSV (Neodataset format)
- Evaluate each story against six quality dimensions:
  - INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
  - Ambiguity detection (e.g., vague or unclear phrasing)
  - Completeness of information (who, what, why)
  - Adherence to standard user story format
  - Actionability (clear and executable language)
  - Scope Tightness (focus and granularity)
- Generate per-story evaluation reports with:
  - Dimension scores (e.g., 1–5)
  - Human-readable explanations of issues
- Improve stories based on evaluation results using an AI agent
- Output both original and improved stories in structured format

*Should Have:*
- Explain why each change was made by the improver

*Could Have:*
- Re-trainable or adaptable agents using updated datasets
- CLI tool to process stories in bulk with evaluation and rewriting

*Won’t Have (in MVP):*
- Web or UI-based interface
- Integration into Agile tooling (e.g., Jira)
- Real-time evaluation or feedback loops
